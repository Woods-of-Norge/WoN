Norwegian National Innovation firm, based on preserving, protecting and production of fine quality wood materials in a harmless, environmental beneficial, Eco friendly way. By using national values as corner stones of the business. We care about our planet, and we see the need for a total change as to how most of the planets Forrests are being violated and destroyed; by greed, poverty, underdeveloped technology and no regards as to how much it "hurts" our whole natural environment for the years/decades to come. This is where we come in, with a totally different approach with Eco friendly, improving substanable growth, engaging local community and of coarse inspire for  heavily reduced need to  import/export wood/materials from the other side of the globe! Therefore; reducing production cost, transportation costs, tax costs and contribute to local communities nation wide! Therefore, we will invest in developing/upgrading  the technology required for the whole production of a high-end, exclusive designs and "niche" products, that would be much cheaper,better in every way possible and of course; alot cheaper than any other companies could  even think of producing! Our goal is for theese other companies to see and learn from this business model, and start doing the same!  For a better future for us all!
